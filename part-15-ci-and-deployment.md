# Part 15 Deploying your nx monorepo

The AngularCLI only generates bundles. This means that we cannot build the lib itself. We can only do it by building an app that depends on it.

And then run

```
ng build --prod -a=admin-portal
```

In this section, we will run some analysis tools to inspect the size of our application.

* Install the [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/th0r/webpack-bundle-analyzer)

```
npm install  --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
```

* Once installed add the following entry to the npm scripts in the package.json:

```
"bundle-report-admin-portal": "webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/apps/admin-portal/stats.json"
```

* Rebuild with --stats-json

```
ng build --prod -a=admin-portal --stats-json
```

* Run the following command

```
 npm run bundle-report
```
