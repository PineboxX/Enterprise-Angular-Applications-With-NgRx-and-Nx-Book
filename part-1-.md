#### 1 .Create a new nx workspace

* Run the below command in a terminal to make a new nx workspace.

```
create-nx-workspace demo-app
```

#### 2. Examine the output of the following files and commit code to git source control

1. Run the following command to open the new nx workspace in VSCode.

```
cd demo-app && code .
```

Until this pull request [https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/198](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/198) is merged run the following in the terminal to avoid warnings in terminal.

```
npm install prettier@1.10.1 --save
```

* Inspect the following files:

  * .angular-cli.json

  * tsconfig paths

  * package.json

#### 3. Change from css to scss

* Open up angular .angular-cli.json and change the default style type.

_**.angular-cli.json**_

```
"styleExt": "scss"
```

* Commit the initial NX workspace to source control

#### 4. Create a new workspace app

* By default a new NX workspace has no apps or libs yet. You can run the below command to see the extra options to make an app or a lib besides the normal angular CLI commands.

```
ng g app --help
```

* Create a new app by running the below command in the terminal in a directory of your choice. 

```
ng g app customer-portal --style scss --routing
```

#### 5. Add ngrx

* Add a default set up for ngrx to our new app. We can run the generate command for ngrx with the module and --onlyEmptyRoot option to only add the StoreModule.forRoot and EffectsModule.forRoot calls without generating any new files versus --root which will make a default reducer and effect.

```
ng g ngrx app --module=apps/customer-portal/src/app/app.module.ts  --onlyEmptyRoot
```

#### 6. Examine angular app and module structure

1. app.module.ts
2. tsconfig paths
3. package.json
4. apps and libs empty

#### 7. Run the app in the browser

* Run the following command to launch the app in the browser. -a is for the app to start and -o is to open in the default browser.

```
ng s -a=customer-portal -o
```

* See the default state of the app in the redux dev tools![](/assets/default-ngrx-state.png)

#### 8. Commit to repo for the class \(Instructor only\)
